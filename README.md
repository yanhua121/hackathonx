Project Name: 
Helper utilities for OpenShift clusters with Nutanix infrastructure

Description
OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is a cloud-based Kubernetes (K8s) container platform. Nutanix partners with the RedHat OpenShift team to facilitate provisioning and managing OCP clusters running with Nutanix infrastructure. However, some of the day-2 operations to manage the OCP cluster are still tedious and error-prone tasks, especially to the new users/customers. To facilitate these day-2 tasks, we want to develop some bash shell scripts to help the users/customers manage their OCP clusters running with Nutanix infrastructure.
